AaronTools provides a collection of tools for automating routine tasks encountered when running quantum chemistry computations.

These tools can be used either directly with a Perl script using AaronTools objects, or via a series of command-line scripts. 

Documentation (still in progress!) is available here: https://github.com/QChASM/Aaron/wiki
